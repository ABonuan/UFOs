Build a webpage to display UFO data

## Overview
There always has been a divide between people who believe in life beyond earth, and those who don't.  A data journalist wants to create a wepbage that will contain data on UFO sightings in an appealing way, as well as an article that will make her audience think - are there such things as UFO's and aliens?  

## Results
The UFO sightings data is displayed as a table that can be filtered by a user's input.  The table shows up as unfiltered when the webpage is first brought up.

On the bottom left of the page, there is a filter section where the user can filter the data by date, city, state, country and \/ or shape of the UFO sighting.  There is an example of what an entry \(input from user\) should look like for each field.

The data can be filtered with a combination of any or all of the filter types.  The user will type in the field, then press Enter.  Here are a couple of examples of how someone can filter the table of UFO Sigthings:

- Filter by Date \(1\/2\/2010\)

- Filter by Date and State \(1\/2\/2010 and ca\)

The table can also be reset to display all data by clicking "UFO Sightings" on the top left of the page

## Summary
A drawback of this webpage is that the data feeding the table is limited and static.  If there are any additional sighting information, the **data** JavaScript file will need to be updated manually.

What would make this webpage more dynamic is adding a functionality that will allow a user to add UFO sightings information.
